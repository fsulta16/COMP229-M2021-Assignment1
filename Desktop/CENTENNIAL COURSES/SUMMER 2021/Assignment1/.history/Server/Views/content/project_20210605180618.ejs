For this project I had to use the data set below to produce a contingency table with a chi-squared analysis and determine if there is an association between red meat consumption and colon cancer. In order to do so a program called SAS was used to input code and analyse the data effectively in order to produce a relationship, which after computing it was found that individuals that consumed more red meat ( over 2lb) have a higher chance of having colon cancer.

<h2 style="font-family:'Courier New'"><strong>Introduction to Database</h2></strong>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
For this project I had to create a database of my choice and implement various tables and keys to display and store the data in an efficient manner. I had decided to create a patient database with various tables such as department, doctor details, patient details, etc. When doing so primary, unique, and foreign keys were included in order to create relationships between the tables as shown on the image. 
include images and information for at least 3 Projects you wish to highlight.

  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
  For this project, a data analysis report was created with regards to analyzing various data produced around the world in which I had to simplify and display the data in an efficient manner for individuals to be able to understand the data. One part of the report was to create an image to display population around the globe based on age as well as relevant worksheets and dashboard for Tourism Inbound and Outbound around the world as well. This was created using the program SAS by inputting code along with choosing the graph format which in this case was a pie chart along with a Mosaic chart was produced.  Thus resulting, graphs displaying an analysis on the data provided.
